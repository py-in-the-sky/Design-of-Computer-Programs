# -----------------
# User Instructions
# 
# In this problem, we introduce doubling to the game of pig. 
# At any point in the game, a player (let's say player A) can
# offer to 'double' the game. Player B then has to decide to 
# 'accept', in which case the game is played through as normal,
# but it is now worth two points, or 'decline,' in which case
# player B immediately loses and player A wins one point. 
#
# Your job is to write two functions. The first, pig_actions_d,
# takes a state (p, me, you, pending, double), as input and 
# returns all of the legal actions.
# 
# The second, strategy_d, is a strategy function which takes a
# state as input and returns one of the possible actions. This
# strategy needs to beat hold_20_d in order for you to be
# marked correct. Happy pigging!
